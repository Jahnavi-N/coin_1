# CoinFlip
Just flip a coin. Easy as that.

Try it: https://dinoosauro.github.io/CoinFlip/

## Usage
![A screenshot of the website](https://github.com/Dinoosauro/CoinFlip/assets/80783030/3c5b8d95-ace8-44d5-8964-8ae1d5a84901)

Open the website, and flip a coin. If you want to, you can click on the coin or on the "Again" button to flip it another time. Really easy.

## Why this
I've certainly done projects that are more complex than this, but, since sometimes I can't decide on something, flipping a coin might be useful. I wanted a website that 

- Wasn't filled with search result
-  Was just throwing a coin, without extra things and with buil-in dark mode

And therefore I created this. It can be used completely offline, even by just downloading the HTML webpage.
